# Journal-Website
WDC assignment

I've made an index page where I'll start putting stuff for the main page template. You can either work on your parts in separate html files (and then combine them later) or work directly on the same index file. (Either way works)

# Bugs/Problems to Fix
<strong> (Add things here as you notice them, then we can come back and fix them later) </strong>

Zooming: at the moment when I try to zoom in on part of the page, everything gets messed up (I think that's because of how I set the template up, so will have to fix that.)

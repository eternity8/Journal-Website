# Journal-Website
WDC assignment

I've made an index page where I'll start putting stuff for the main page template. You can either work on your parts in separate html files (and then combine them later) or work directly on the same index file. (Either way works)

# To Do List:Bugs/Problems to Fix
<strong> (Add things here as you notice them, then we can come back and fix them later) </strong>

Zooming: at the moment when I try to zoom in on part of the page, everything gets messed up (I think that's because of how I set the template up, so will have to fix that.)

Edges/Borders: There are a couple of spots where the edges of boxes don't quite line up with the container. I think it could just be the border width throwing things out slightly. (sometimes the 'boxstyle:border-box' property can be handy for fixing this).

Input Limits: At some point we'll need to put limits on the input fields for dates, check for valid/invalid entries

Mobile/Small Width view: If we get time it would be good to add in media queries and some javascript to implement a view for small width screens/windows. I can probably have a go at this.
